For the purposes of learning to play or 'recite' a piano piece played by P Miller in a youtube video I would like to:

Build an annotatable video playback tool in order to annotate the times when each finger is pressing each key and have it generate some kind of midi playback so that I can listen back and know that what I'm guessing for the fingering and timing is on the right track.

A mobile app or web app that:

Plays the video in slow motion (50%, 75%).

Lets you loop exact timestamps.

Lets you tag events (“LH 3rd finger on A3”).

Optionally, stores textual notation of the sequence that you can review away from the piano.

The data can just be JSON: { time: 12.342, hand: 'L', finger: 3, note: 'A3' }.

It should eventually support "annotation goals"... like one should be able to define a section of the video (e.g. a 1 to 6 second passage), work on the annotations for that section and then mark it as done and so be ready to move onto the next section. As one is working on each section it should have a really easy and intuitive interface to facilitate the multiple rewinds and replays (potentially at different speeds), relistening and checking the transcription in progress that are needed to get a small section done. At every step of the way the program should encourage working in a musically relevant way... like a way that helps develop good musical habits so that the more you work with the program the quicker you will become at completing transcriptions and annotations.

Ideally I would like to develop this app rapidly in Vue.js with typescript.

A first goal might be to be able to pause playback of a video file and add an annotation that gets displayed somehow on the next playback at the correct time (time where the video was paused). I think I will probably need frame by frame playback control (ideally mimicing youtubes keyboard interface with ',' for back a frame and '.' for forward a frame). 

I would also like to know how to structure the project so that the videos (.mp4 files) and associated .json annotation files are not stored in the git repo.

I think as opposed to you giving me a ready made solution I would prefer if you can give me say the first 10 steps of getting to a reasonable goal... ie the first step might be run 'npm create vite@latest' or similar... this way I can follow along with the steps a bit like a tutorial and understand what is going on.
